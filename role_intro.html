                <h3>SpongeBob SquarePants</h3>
                <p>The eponymous character and protagonist of "SpongeBob SquarePants". A yellow rectangular sponge, his body is made up like a cleaning sponge. His birthday is July 14, 1986. He has two left hands, each with four fingers. He wears brown shorts, a white shirt and a red tie. He is immortal, and can restore his body to its original state even if it is damaged. Although he eats normally, he can survive by filtering seawater. He has weak physical strength, and the so-called dumbbells are actually plush toys; but as the plot develops, it seems to gradually improve.</p>

He works as a counter staff at the "Krusty Krab Restaurant", but he doesn't like his job. He likes to play the recorder and paint self-portraits in various styles. He hates SpongeBob and Patrick (especially the former), and occasionally expresses his approval of SpongeBob, but usually when it is beneficial to him.</p>

                    <h3>Mr. Krabs</h3>
                    <p>Red Crab, whose real name is Crab Ajin, was nicknamed "Iron Armor Golden Bell" when he served in the Navy. He regards money as his life and often risks his life for a dollar. He is extremely selfish. As the operator of the fast food restaurant "Krusty Krab", he has repeatedly preached to employees that they should have a sense of time, because "time is money". As long as he finds a product that can make a quick buck, he will ignore the old delicious crab burger and change his target. During business hours, he often reads newspapers, counts money, takes money baths, etc. in the office. He likes to watch satirical dramas and is a sworn enemy of Mr. Krabs.</p>

                    <h3>Gary</h3>
                    <p>SpongeBob's pet snail can only meow. It has the ability to understand natural language and communicate. Although it is a snail, it occasionally wears cloth shoes, so the bottom has hidden feet. It even taught SpongeBob how to tie shoelaces. The inner shell contains some of SpongeBob's things, such as photos of the snail, a clock for eating, and mucus. The outer shell is equipped with a parachute mechanism. If something is stuck at the bottom, it will go crazy and bite people because of discomfort. Hate taking a bath. In dreams, it can use natural language to talk. Its IQ is even higher than SpongeBob's. It is a philosopher.</p>

                    <h3>Sandy</h3>
                    <p>A female squirrel from Texas, she is a scientist, explorer and inventor. She loves sports (especially karate and sandboarding) and science, and is also a champion of rodeo. Since squirrels are terrestrial creatures, they need to breathe air, so they have to wear space suits and helmets on the seafloor. They usually live in an underwater tree house under a large circular reinforced glass protective cover. The internal environment is the same as on land, and it can rotate with the seasons; if marine creatures enter, they must wear a helmet filled with water. They need to hibernate, and their mood is quite irritable during this period.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Krabs' nemesis and the main villain of SpongeBob SquarePants. He is made up of 1% evil and 99% hotgas. He has only one eye, which often hurts because he forgets to blink.

In order to make his restaurant business prosperous, he has been stealing the ancestral secret recipe of the famous "Krab Patty" of the Krusty Krab, but he has never succeeded. His biggest hope is to rule the world.</p>
